Hi! Thank you for downloading the Autodemo Speed Highway mod for SADX PC/Steam. This mod was made by the same guys who brought you the Autodemo Windy Valley mod. The differences between the final version of Speed Highway and the Autodemo version may not be immediately noticeable (until you reach Act 3), so I've compiled a list of differences I saw when porting the level over that you can use to guide you to the individual differences.

Objects
-------

-Blue skylights have their bottoms modeled and use some unique textures that were removed from the final game in favor of common textures with environmental mapping applied to them. Their tops are also untextured (which may be intentional, probably to convey extremely bright light), whereas in the final they use a reflective white texture.
-Tiny pink pyramid-shaped lights use different textures, including a pink one that was removed from the final game. Its model is also slightly different.
-Yellow platforms that hook onto walls in Act 1 are much smaller than in the final game.
-The bells in the level use a unique silver texture that was removed from the final game in favor of using a common gold-colored one.
-One of the giant neon signs (O NEON1) uses a few different textures.
-Red/pink arrow signs in Act 1 use a different black and yellow "caution" texture on their tops that uses alpha.
-Small metal "pins" that appear in Acts 1 and 3 use a few different textures.
-Radio towers that appear in Tails's version of the level in the final game have an almost completely different design, with very different textures and collision. The beta radio tower does not appear in the Autodemo because: it is not easy to take control of Tails in this level in the AD, and he lacks a unique layout for the level.
-Small potted plants at the bottom of Act 2 (Going Down segment) and on some walls in Act 3 use different textures for their pots, a texture that was removed from the level in the final. The taller variant also had a unique texture for its soil and had addition detail on its stem; both of these are absent in the final game (with the texture being completely removed from the game's files, while the stem detail would be used on other models in the game).
-Posters (that have edges) in Act 3 are smaller and use different colors for their edges.
-Newspaper boxes are smaller and their collision is smaller as well.
-Wall platforms in Act 3 are smaller, and their models have been adjusted slightly since they were placed in the Autodemo object layouts with an even earlier version of the model in mind, and it was causing them to be stuck in the walls halfway.
-Signs lit up by lights attached to them have a slightly different model, and use different textures for their edges.
-Beta trashcan object has its original design and textures present, and is used in the level in Act 3.
-Grass circle that is under the fountain and a clock in Act 3 uses many additional, different textures. At least one was completely removed from the final game.
-Grass square in the later part of Act 3 (where Knuckles starts and Sonic ends) uses different textures. At least one was completely removed from the final game.
-Water tanks that Knuckles can break in Act 3 use many unique textures that were completely removed from the final game in favor of common reflective textures with environmental mapping applied to them. Their insides are also untextured, whereas in the final they use a reflective texture.
-The cars that speed around in Act 3 use their beta models from prerelease screenshots and the unveiling. In the Autodemo, they were set to randomize their colors each time you entered the level, so that's what they'll do here too! Each type of car has 7 different colors to choose from. The big bus will also randomly swap between two versions of it that were found in the Autodemo, like the colors.


Level
-----
-Acts 1 and 2 of the level didn't change much in terms of level geometry, but the object layouts are still pretty different.
-Act 3 is very different from the final. Go and see for yourself if you haven't already. It's the same general idea as its version in the final game, but is more open and has more detailed buildings.


Music
-----
-Has yet to be put into the mod, but Act 1's music and Act 2's music were slightly different in the Autodemo.


Extra
-----
-Two cheat codes have been provided:
	-Press and hold X while the level loads to make the benches in Act 3 use a red and blue color scheme instead of the red and yellow one in the final and Autodemo. This is how the benches looked in the unveiling of the game.
	-Press and hold Y while the level loads to make the 180 launching machines in Act 1 use their smaller size from the unveiling. (This is actually how the model is normally in the Autodemo, but it seems the Autodemo stretches the model to make it match the final's size. The final game does not do this, instead just using a stretched-out model by default)
	(Both of these cheats can be active and activated at the same time.)
